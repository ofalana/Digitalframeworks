The number of complaint cases filed at Bangladesh’s Cyber Tribunal has significantly increased over the last few years, and supporters of the government, according to a Human Rights Analysis, mostly file the complaints. This trend might suggest that the government is using a fragment (section 57) of the ICT Act as a way to target its critics and opposition. 

The Information and Communication Technology Act (ICT Act) was presented by the Bangladeshi government as legislation to fight cyber crimes. However, international bodies such as the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) have condemned the act as an attack of freedom of expression on the Internet. 
 
Section 57 gives local police the authority to use complaints filed by citizens as grounds for arrests. The case is referred to the Cyber Tribunal if the police determine there is sufficient evidence to support the initial complaint. The Tribunal then files charges against the accused and then a trial begins. 

The data is trustworthy because was gathered by Human Rights Watch, an organization that is widely known to be credible and reliable. The data can also be reviewed by comparing Human Rights Watch’s numbers with records directly from local Bangladeshi police or records from the Cyber Tribunal. 

While the data collected showed the number of substantiated complaints filed, one complaint can contain allegation against multiple people. With further investigation, it’ll be interesting to compare the number of cases filed, and the number of arrests made from each complaint.
