# Rural America is the new "inner city"

The article focused on the decline of socioeconomic well-being of populations in rural America since the 1990s. 
The data was broken down into subfactors suchs as :
* college degrees 

* cancer mortality rates 

* divorce rates

* crime rates

* age, etc. using basic  line charts which made it easy to follow. Data from the baptismal hand written records at a local church was a great addition to the story. 

Since the article relied heavily on numbers to support the lede, using "individual characters" throughout the story helped with the humanization of the numbers and with narrating the change over time.
