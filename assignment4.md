Trump expenditure 

I sorted the data by Congressional candidates and how much they have spent at Trump’s businesses.  In total these candidates spent $75,048.95 at Trump’s businesses. I made a pivot table for the 2018 election year and found that Congressional candidates spent $40,788.64 at Trump businesses. For the 2020 election campaign (Pivot table named 2020 campaign),  $385.99 has been spent at Trump’s international hotel. 

In some instances, the election year was not listed, so I sorted it out and created a different pivot table named ’no election year’. For this category, congressional candidates spent $33,874.32


Most of these payments were described as food, beverages, lodging, event catering, event facility rental,  and event meeting. 

While these candidates weren’t contributing to Donald Trump’s campaign directly, it raises the question of the intent of patronizing his businesses.  Is it a action showing their support of the president? Is it a strategy to get the President to campaign for them? Or to get an endorsement from the president? Or is it in hopes to get some face time with the President? 

I also made charts based on the data form the ‘count of disbursement_description’ column. For 2018 campaign, candidates spent more money on event room and catering costs. Under the no election categories, candidates spent more money on food and beverages.

Under the no election categories, candidates spent more money on food and beverages.

This also reinforces the concerns some have that perhaps Trump and his businesses are financially benefitting from his presidency.
