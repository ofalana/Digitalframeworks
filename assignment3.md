# Where are they now? Detainees released from Guantanamo
Over 700 detainees have been released from the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay since the military prison opened in 2002 during the war on terror. I'm interested in the terms of their release, what they're doing now and how common is recidivism amongst the released detainees. 
Here are the features I'll be collecting: 
* Names of detainees
* Date released 
* Country released to
* Conditions of release
* Released under what administration
* Recidivism

I will collect the data by reveiwing Guantanamo Task Force documents, Transcripts from the tribunals and periodic review board, transcripts and documents from the military commission court, news articles etc

* A table including at least five data points in this dataset:
