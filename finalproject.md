In peacetime, nation-states invest millions of dollars to expand, modernize and strengthen their armed forces to protect their sovereignty and in preparation for potential conflicts. 
 
When those conflicts arise, where are countries importing weapons from and in what conditions are they getting them?

Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), an international organization specialized in research into conflict, arms control and disarmament keeps records of transfers of major weapons. 
 
An analysis of SIPRI’s records shows that these deals are often complex and can involve multiple countries. For example, in 2002 Poland delivered 67 auxiliary armored tracked vehicles to Nigeria as part of a $6.5 million deal financed by the United Nations and/or the United States to be used by Nigerian peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone. 

Combat helicopters, Light attack aircrafts, self-propelled multiple rocket launchers, MRAP (Mine- Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicles are some of the weapons that have been supplied to countries in conflict. 

Although the weapons are usually second- hand, for example, the light attack aircraft Nigeria purchased in 2016 to use against rebel forces, they sometimes go through a modernization process before delivery. 

 Depending on the type of weapon, order delivery could take any time between one to five years. 

Third parties as in the case of two separate incidents involving South Sudan sometimes intercept these deliveries. 

In 2008, Somali pirates temporarily held ransom South Sudan’s six self-propelled multiple rocket launchers after intercepting the delivery ship from Ukraine. 

Countries in conflict often times receive aid from international organizations and foreign countries such as the United Nations and the United States. However, such aid is not limited to humanitarian services. Analysis of Sipri’s records shows that Niger and Nigeria received weapons from France and Germany respectively as a form of aid. 


The frequency of arm transfer deals changes over the years in some situation. After a 10-year hiatus between Nigeria and the United States, the West African country resumed business with the U.S. with the procurement of an offshore patrol vessel. 

Weapons transfer is a prominent way a country can express their allegiance to opposing sides of a conflict. For example, since the start of the civil war in Syria, Russia and Iran have supplied the Syrian government with weapons in support of Syrian president Bashar al- Assad. While the United States has supplied opposing Syrian rebel groups. 

Tracking down the weaponry suppliers of non-state actors like ISIS can be an impossible mission.  Nonetheless, Conflict Armament Research, an organization that identifies and tracks weapons and ammunition in armed conflicts, reported that anti-tank rockets taken from captured Islamic State forces were identical to M79 rockets transferred by Saudi Arabia to the ‘Free Syrian Army’ forces in 2013.  The report also found Chinese manufactured machine guns. 


Ongoing Conflicts in Recipient Countries Mentioned Above

NIGERIA 

While the federal government has not officially declared a civil war in the country, conflicts over land ownership and political and religious affiliations have been going on for the past few years.  In the first few weeks of 2018 more people were killed in Nigeria than in war-stricken Syria, according to a Vanguard, a Nigerian newspaper report. 

The Nigerian government has been in an endless battle with Boko Haram, a Jihadist militant organization since 2009. The terrorist pledged allegiance to ISIS in an audio statement, early 2015. The group is responsible for the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from a town in North-eastern Nigeria, which led to a viral ‘Bring Back Our Girls’ campaign.  

Escalating in the central region of Nigeria is the ongoing conflict between Fulani herdsmen and local farmers over land ownership. 

The tug of war between the nomadic group and the indigenous farming community has led to deadly attacks and damaged property. 

More than 549 deaths and thousands of displaced people in 12 states are a result of the clashes between herdsmen and farming communities according to human rights organization, Amnesty International.  

The federal government has tried to intervene however the deadly attacks have continued. 

In an attack of five villages in Adamawa, avenging a previous attack that killed 57 people, herdsmen, and air force bombing, according to an Amnesty International report killed state 86 people.  The report found that residents reported being attacked by a fighter jet and a military helicopter as they attempted to flee. 

NIGER
The spread of Boko Haram across West Africa has forced Niger to play a major role in the fight against terrorism in the region.  The country joined four neighboring countries in the Sahel region to form a joint force in 2014 called the G-5 Sahel. 

Niger’s military is also partnering with foreign militaries outside the Sahel region such as the French and American military forces for training exercises and financial aid to support their fight against Boko Haram and other armed groups. 

In 2017, at least 70 attacks by Boko Haram and other armed groups, in four regions resulted in the death of at least 30 people and abduction of over 60 people according to an Amnesty International report.

SOUTH SUDAN 
Almost immediately after South Sudan gained its independence in July 2011, interethnic clashes broke out leading to deadly attacks across the country.  Shortly after, a civil war began as a result of an alleged attempted coup d’etat led by the president’s former deputy.  The armed conflict between government forces and opposition forces has led to food insecurity of an estimated 4.8 million people, almost half of the population, and the displacement of 3.9 million people according to Amnesty International.

SYRIA
What started as a political revolution seven years ago has resulted in the death of more 400,00 people and displacement of more than 11 million people.

Critics of Syria’s President Bashar al- Assad, who took to the street in March 2011 to call for political reform, were countered with force from security forces.  Several rebel groups including Jihadist group, ISIS,  birthed from the conflict have battled with Assad for control over cities and towns in the country. The conflicts eventually spread to major cities like Aleppo and the country’s capital Damascus.
