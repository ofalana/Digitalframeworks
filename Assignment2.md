# How did the U.S. commanders spend $2 billion in Afghanistan?

ProPublica has a reputation of providing credible datasets for investigative journalism. The data was obtained from the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  (SIGAR) through a Freedom of International Act request. 

SIGAR was created by Congress to provide oversight of the Afghanistan Reconstruction funds. Data from SIGAR can be treated as credible because they work with the Office of the Inspector General at the State and Defense departments, and the Office of Inspector General at the Agency for International Development. 

The data details the $2 billion payments made by U.S. commanders under the Commander’s Emergency Response Program, during the Afghanistan war. 
Under the Commander’s Emergency Response Program, commanders were authorized to spend money on reconstruction projects “as a tool to address causes of instability in their areas of operations. 

I’m interested in breaking down the distribution of the funds by:

* Location (province)
* Date
* Project coordination with locals
* Project type
* Project results 
* Project goals 
* Funding fiscal year
* Security concerns 
* Length of project 
* Direct benefit to locals 

A couple of other categories I’m interested in were retracted or simply labeled classified; however, the list above is sufficient to answer how $2billion was spent.
